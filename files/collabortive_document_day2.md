## üß† Collaborative Notes & üîß Exercises

### Exercise: What questions do you have? (5 min)

Yesterday we asked you to read some resources about the logistics of teaching and running Carpentries workshops.

Please add your questions about logistics and preparation to the Etherpad.

We will answer these questions in the Etherpad during your work time and will return to this list later today.


Do all workshops need a shared document?
- it's not a requirement, online workshop is difficult to conduct without the collaborative document, in some cases in in-person workshop, it may not be neccesary to have one, depending on the setup.
- 
How to know how many helpers are needed?
- rule of thumb, around 1 helper for 7 participants 

Are we able to have access to the documents after the course?
- yes, we will archiv it and share the link with you

Are the courses only meant to be delivered to novices? Is there a possibility to prepare a workshop for more advanced users for example? :+1:
- Yes you can do that, but that won't be an official Carpentries workshop

The Carpentry documents refer to Etherpad as the collaborative document system while here we are using CodiMD (which I think is an open-source fork of the software behind HackMD? ‚Äì  Adrian: Yes, it is and by now CodiMD is named [HedgeDoc](https://docs.hedgedoc.org/faq/) - thanks for the link :) ). Is there any particular advantages of one platform over the other?
- we use codi.md because it's more flexible than the ehterpad, which makes it more convenient in the online workshop
- CodiMD is nicer to share pictures; you have markdown formatting with headings etc. and can easily create  a table of contents with `toc`; HedgeDoc/CodiMD also support an [easy way to create nice HTML slides with Markdown](https://demo.hedgedoc.org/p/slide-example#/) (which doesn't matter much for Carpentries, though, only maybe for instructors); See all HedgeDoc features at https://demo.hedgedoc.org/features :+1:

Collaborative Documents and GDPR?
- before we archive the documents we will srtrip them off of personal data

Is it OK to deliver a workshop over a long period of time? (E.g. weekly/fortnighty).
- yes, you can distribute the workshop in time as you see fit, as long as you cover all the core content

if it is a self organized instructor or software workshop you can decide about the periode of time 
- see previous question

How to instruct and communicate with Helpers?
- online workshops via Chat, in in person workshops within the breaks and between the workshops
- you can 

How to deal with absent students?
- There are always no-shows, you cannot do anything about it
- You can state that people should not be joining only part (one day of the workshop). You cannot do 

How is the turnaround wrt people sending turnaround and attendance from self-organised workshops to The Carpentries Workshop Administration Team? Or do you think, there are many workshops happening without this reporting?
- I don't think anyone reports attendance in worskhops, neither centrally nor self-organised

How would you schedule a training session which intends to be delivered for 2 days? Half-day for 4 days? Or just 2 full-day session? Pros and cons?
- Half-day for 4 days
less tireing but you have to find more fitting dates
advantges you have time for the daily work at the workshop day
- 2 full-day session
more strenuous than 4 days
but you only have to find 2 suitable days
you do not have time for daily work at the workshop day
- for online worksops it is definitely better to teach over four half days

Are self organized workshops free in terms of content?
- we come to this later today
- if you want to call it a Carpentry, you need to stick to core curriculum

## Getting Started on Instructor Certification

### Exercise: Be The Expert: Checkout Q & A (10 min)
In breakout rooms, read and discuss one of the three checkout procedures described on this page: https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/index.html

Make notes in the Collaborative Document:
1. What points do you think it is most important or helpful for people to remember?
2. What questions or points of confusion do you have, or think others might have? When you are done, report back to the full group about that stage of the process.

**until 9:36**

* room 1 
    * Community discussions are there to help, places for you to pose your questions about teaching
    * Can we organize local/company meet-up/community discussion?
* room 2 
  1. Main point appears to be promote involvement in community and familiarization with tools used.
  2. Is there a separate requirement for being an instructor in a workshop in some timeframe (12 months?) after training?
* room 3 
* 
    * Looking at the regional community calls, I wonder whether there also is a central Europe community or similar. I wouldn't know which one to attend from Germany.
    * Confusing: the community discussions Etherpad looks quite overwhelming (it might help to have it in CodiMD with a Table of Contents at the beginning so that you get an easy overview)
* room 4 
    * helpful: 
        * the message "try to relax" and "embrace your mistakes" is very helpful
        * participatory live conding/work for about 5 min is required
    * confusion:
        * (not in fact a point of confusion) but it is missing a closing brackets on the 2nd paragraph on section [1 Lesson = Several Episodes: preparing to teach a lesson](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/index.html#1-lesson--several-episodes-preparing-to-teach-a-lesson)
* room 5 
    * helpful: the contribution is to bring you into the community
    * helpful: lower barrier to entry if submitting issue rather than PR
    * confusion: GitHub can be intimidating
* room 6 
    * helpful/important: you *must* do the checkout within three months;
    * confusion: what if can't arrange a time for demonstration/discussion within the three months?
    * I already contributed to the Glossary. Does it count for the check-out procedure?
    * confusion: How to arrange a teaching demonstration?

### Exercise: Schedule a Discussion or Demo (5 min)

Visit the discussion Etherpad to sign up for a session: https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions If the session you would like to attend is full, contact the discussion host and co-host to ask if you can attend.

If you would prefer to do your teaching demonstration before your discussion, visit the demo Etherpad and sign up there: https://pad.carpentries.org/teaching-demos This demo rubric is provided as a guide for Trainers evaluating potential new Instructors during the teaching demonstration.

**until 9:49**

### Exercise: Get Connected (5 min)

Take a couple of minutes to sign up for The Carpentries channels you want to stay involved with on this page: [https://carpentries.org/connect/](https://carpentries.org/connect/)

When you are done, share a channel you find interesting or useful on the Collaborative Document.

**until 10:30**

* slack
* Joined Slack channel
* The "Teaching Demo" is an event that I would really consider joining (part of Community Events)
* I am already following Library Carpentry on GitHub. I don't (like to) use Slack but there is a Matrix bridge to the Library Carpentries Slack at https://matrix.to/#/#library-carpentry:matrix.org which let me subscribe to it
* Joined Slack
* Started following @datacarpentry and @LibCarpentry on Twitter
* Following LinkedIn profile
* *Sugestion*: The Carpentries on Mastodon?
* joined Slack

## ‚òï Break until 10:45

## Live Coding is a Skill

Questions:
    - Why do we teach programming using participatory live coding?
Objectives:
    Explain the advantages and limitations of participatory live coding.
    Summarize the key dos and do nots of participatory live coding.
    Demonstrate participatory live coding.
 
### Exercise: Up and Down
List some advantages and challenges of participatory live coding from both a learner‚Äôs and an instructor‚Äôs point of view in the collaborative doc.
 
This discussion should take about 5 minutes.

* 
    * Advantages: helps to keep everyone on the same pace; allows for instructor to solve errors live
    * Disadvantages: more risk for errors which might slow down the lecture
* 
    * Advantages: 
        * learning from a peer by watching the process
        * mistakes can be easily taken as opportunites to learn
        * gives the best possible insight into the tooling
    * Disadvantages:
        * puts more stress on the instructor
        * more opportunities for technical things to go wrong
        * setting up necessary software as barrier for participation
* 
    * Advantages: learning by doing, students can immediately identify potential challenges
    * Challenges: might be hard for the instructor to find a speed that suits the whole audience; might also be hard to help everyone, even with helpers; might be more stressful for the instructor
* 
  * _Why_: Encouraging participants to try out examples for themselves and experiment with code.
  * _Advantages_: 
    * Ensures learners have software set up for later use / review of material
    * Greater engagement and chance for experimentation
    * Helps to regulate speed of delivery of material by having instructor type in commands
  * _Challenges_:
    * Setting up displays such that code is readable and learners can see both instructors code and own (particularly online)
    * Technical problems in getting required software set up 
* 
    * Advantages:
        * learning by coding (for both instructor and audience)
        * applied examples and deadling with any kind of error (for audience)
    * Disadvantages: 
        * Can stuck with a bug (instructor)
        * Techincal problems (for both instructor and audience)
* 
    * Advantage: demystifies process, shows skilled person working
    * Disadvantage: could go wrong, confuse learners
* 
    * Advantages: trouble shoot live, answer questions for students, learners have an example they can go back to and work through
    * Disadvantages: technical difficulties, people can fall behind, getting everyone set up can take time
* 
    * *plus*: ability for learners to follow along and ensure everyone is on the same page
    * *plus*: ability to demonstrate how to deal with errors or bugs
    * *minus*: some unexpected bugs can sometimes take a while to fix, which might slow down the pace of teaching
    * *minus*: typing and speaking can be challenging at times
* 
    * advantages
        * gives time to explain coding concepts while coding, less dry (we init the class, setting a class parameter, etc)
        * gives the teacher a chance to make errors and correct them
        * makes a progression simple -> complex more natural (e.g. why make code more abstract? see for yourself)
        * easier to engage students
    * disadvanteges
        * higher cognitive load for the instructor, more demanding
            * keep lesson in mind
            * keep data and functions in mind
            * typing
            * dealing with own errors (can you solve them on the spot?)
            * hard to monitor students at the same time
        * easier to loose students
            * code disappears from window, etc
            * might not notice
        * Technical aspects:
            * for remote, it's possible to share a window only and keep the script open besides, easy to keep up with a script
            * in person, the entire screen is projected, can't have both script and code open at the same time
            * difficulty increases with course duration
* 
    * Advantages
        * Allows interaction and helps break the ice between instructor and student
        * Participation can create a personal involvement for the student
    * Disadvantages
        * Some students may not like to be put on the spot
        * Requires more time than non-interactive teaching methods
        * Instructor must divide his attention between typing and explaining the code at the same time
        * Difficult if done onn an online meeting/session
* 
    * Adv: For learners, immediately relevant visual aid to presentation; for instructor, provides space to talk through their coding thought process live
    * Dis: For learners, split attention, especially if unfamiliar with coding; for instructors, split attention again, especially if wanting to make tangential point in speech
* 
* 
    * advantage: learning by doing practical tasks helps a lot
    * challenge for studants: having all the environment working properly sometimes is tricky
    * challenge for the instructor: finding a good balance between "slow" and "fast" is hard
* 
    * Advantage: learners see how things are done real-time and can follow along (learning by practice)
    * Challenge: deciding on the right pace
    * Challenge: compatibility or other technical issues might slow down some learners and prevent them from following
* 
  * Advantages: 
    * More intuitive for learners;
    * Able to get real-time feedbacks; 
  * Challenges: 
    * A bit difficult to control the pace
    * Sometimes getting nervous when error occurs
* 
    * Advantages: Have a chance to observe the practical usages of the tools, materials and learn by doing together
    * Chalenges: Technical problems that might interrupt smooth learning or might be overwheming 
* 
    * Advantages:
        * Provides feedback on the knowledge background of trainees
        * Better experience for trainees regarding real-life scenarios
    * Challenges:
        * Sometimes explanations require a determined degree of abstraction, which needs additional audio-visual resources 
* 
    * For learners: 
    * 1) Live coding gives the ability to learn any programming language using practical approach.
    * 2) Learners can code alongside the instructors
    * 3) Pace is sometimes fast

    * For Instructors:
    * 1) More interactive
    * 2) Program Output generated on-fly
    * 3) Error debugging easy to explain

### Exercise: Watch this first participatory live coding demo video: 
https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE and this second demo video: https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY as a group and then summarize your feedback on both in the Etherpad. Use the 2x2 rubric for feedback we discussed earlier.

In the videos, the bash shell for loop is taught, and it is assumed learners are familiar with how to use a variable, the head command and the content of the basilisk.dat unicorn.dat files.

Note: Sometime sounds in the room can be poor. Turning on closed captioning by pressing the cc button will improve the accessibility of these videos.

This exercise and discussion should take about 15 minutes.
- Content
    - Positive
    - Constructive
- Delivery
    - Positive
    - Constructive

* 
    * Positive: Live coding (1,2) with typo that is turned into an opportunity for further explanations (2); display Terminal in full screen for good readibility (2); 
    * Contructive: Close apps with notifications that can disturb the lecture (whatsapp) (1); explain the error message (headn: command not found) (1,2)
* 
    * Content
        - Positive: 
            - the explanations are clear and sufficient
            - Good to explicitely show how variable names are arbitrary
        - Constructive: 
            - it would be even better to comment on the shell and bigger than sign while typing the command and not afterwards.
    - Delivery
        - Positive: 
            - font is big enough to read comfortably
            - It is much better in the second version when he stops typing the command and indicates on the screen what he is actually talking about
            - It is great how the error is handled in the second version so that you can learn a lot from the explanation (about commands, loops and hitting the up key to move back in the bash history)
        - Constructive:
            - The error is no problem but it would be nice to explain what happened to turn it into a learnign experience

- Content
    - Positive : Both videos, the content is relatively clear
    - Constructive : But only explains error in second presentation
- Delivery
    - Positive : Presentation in second video is good, coding while speaking, has clear background, has chosen colour and font size of terminal to suit presentation needs, has kept background clear and messanger apps off/silent, and uses the code terminal as a blackboard, manually pointing to things irl
    - Constructive : The first video should build on the positives of the second
* 
    * Content, Positive:
        * 2nd presentation spend time explaining the results on the screen about each file, contents, etc
        * The screen is clean and easy to follow the commands typed live what make it easy to understand the content
    * Content, Construtive:
        * ON 1st presentation would be better to use white background color on terminal, it would be better to read the commands
    * Presentation, Positive:
        * Good that the files was listed before start the shell script part with the `ls` command
    * Presentation, Construtive:
        * On 1st video the terminal prompt is too long, quite impossible to understand the commands typed
        * It would be good to show the files in a usual way, by command line, or using file explorer, before start teaching shell loop
        * Mixing up bash history while the presentation focus is bash loops doesn't help the learners, it would be better if avoid using the arrow keys to recover last command typed
* 
    * Delivery Positive: it was interactive, explaining while typing, and then explaining using the commands on screen
    * Delivery Constructive: have the terminal full screen do avoid distructions
    * Content positive: clear explanations on the commands used. Also good demonstration of the use of variables. Also positive that he made an error and showed how to debug

    * Positive
        * In the second video, the instructor is more engaged.
        * Content in both the videos are relatively clear.
        * In the second video, the instructor points and explains the concepts.
        * Decent font size for live coding.
    * Constructive:
        * Phones/ringtones create distraction. Phones should be kept on silent.
        * In the first video, the instructor is teaching while sitting. This style of teaching should be avoided.
        * Explaining concepts should include pointing to the code where the instructor wants the learners to focus.
        * Eye contact to the audience is really important.
        * Font size is small, which should be avoided.

### Top Ten Tips for Participatory Live Coding in a Workshop
1) Stand up and move around the room if possible. This makes the experience more interactive and less monotonous. Use a microphone if one is available to make it easier for people with hearing difficulties to hear you.
2) Go slowly.
3) Mirror your learner‚Äôs environment. 
4) Use your screen wisely. 
5) Use illustrations 
6) Turn off notifications 
7) Stick to the lesson material. 
8) Leave no learner behind.
9) Embrace mistakes. 
10) Have fun! ü§∏‚Äç

### Exercise: Practice Teaching (25 minutes) 
- Split into groups of three.
- Assign roles, which will rotate: presenter, timekeeper, note-taker.
- Have each group member teach 3 minutes of your chosen lesson episode using live coding. For this exercise, your peers will not ‚Äúcode-along.‚Äù Before you begin, briefly describe what you will be teaching and what has been learned previously. Do not record this exercise.
- After each person finishes, each group member should share feedback (starting with themselves) using the same 2x2 rubric as yesterday. The timekeeper should keep feedback discussion to about 1 minute per person; this may leave some time at the end for general discussion. The note-taker should record feedback in the Etherpad.
- Trade off roles.

### Keypoints:

- Live coding forces the instructor to slow down.
- Coding-along gives learners continuous practice and feedback.
- Mistakes made during participatory live coding are valuable learning opportunities.

### Exercise: Imagine a Learner (5 min)
Take a moment to silently imagine a learner who might attend your workshop. What is their background? What problem do they face? What will they gain from attending your workshop? Write notes in the collaborative doc.

*
    * Learner born in the 1970s. Studied humanities at university and has only used computers as either typewriters or web kiosks. They never had any computing training at work and schoold did not offer the subject at the time they went through the education system. They have worked with computers for years but limited to office applications but must work is papaer-based. The pandemic starts and they are told to work remotely and replacing pysical for digital contents. They do not understand what a computer is and what it can do so attending basic workshops should give them the opportunity to get the computers to work for them and cope with all the new technology that is thrown at them.  Ideally there should be a basic computing skills and concepts course in carpentries.
* 
    * My learner is a parent, and has to leave precisely at the end of the workshop to pick up the children and might not have the time/energy to do the homeworks. >> make sure that the workshop finishes on time and no mandatory homeworks - attending the workshop should fit in the planned schedule so that it does not create extra unexpected stress!
* 
    * people working in libraries and related institutions without an IT background
    * working with data is a common task in many libraries. They are interested in tools and strategies to easily query, transform, enrich, reconcile data
    * they will learn that they can do basic IT work by themselves and that errors are not a problem but necessary to learn and to arrive at a solution to your problem (to write a working script you must first write some scripts that are not working) 
* 
    * Background: librarians, scientists, anyone working daily with a computer
    * Problems: they sometimes have to repeat a task many times
    * Gain: automation of tasks
* 
  * Parent with young child. In an online setting need for regular breaks potentially, and also flexibility with needing to be away from desks for short periods. In in-person setting, potentially need for specific on site facilities, taking in to account need for drop-offs / pick-ups in scheduling of workshop. 
* 
    * undergraduate biologist who has no coding experience. 
    * Needs to analyze self-generated omics data since the bioinformatician left the group.
    * how to handle/analyze big data in R. 
* 
    * New PhD student hoping to gain programming skills to peform their research. Their background will be little to no programming (undergraduate course perhaps) but they have other technical skills. Their problem is often feeling frustrated with being unable to do the research they imagine or have planned. They could gain basic competency but more importantly confidence from an introduction to programming course.
* 
    * Researchers from an AHSS background who has not had to consider their outputs as data before. They may not have considered how to make it accessible to a third party. Little experience of data cleaning and documentation. They will learn how to clean and organise their data and document the steps taken so that they can share it post-project. 
* 
    * Learner comes from a discipline in the humanities, with no experience of using a computer beyond that of a basic user (email, word, internet), but is willing to learn more about how to code. They're keen to introduce some digital methodologies to their normally analogic research flow, but don't know where to start. They will struggle with the most basic concepts of programming (what is a variable? what is a function?), but know that some of what they want to do can be automated. Attending the workshop would give them a basic understanding of how to create helpful scripts to make their routine research tasks quicker.
* 
    Most likely: 1st year (1st semester?) Neuroscience Master / PhD Student.
    Little-to-medium experience coding / maybe took coding courses before
    Diverse fields of study -> diverse requests of the language
    Most likely only experience in Excel and Matlab
    Will have questions along the lines of 'Why is this way better?', 'How to do X', already knowing what they want to do
    Relatively diverse cultural background, maybe first few months abroad
* 
    * Biologist with some "fear" of coding
    * Ease them in with parrallels to point-and-click
* 
* 
    * background: social sciences researcher, some python skills
    * problem: need to collect data from a list of different websites and create a structured normalized dataset
    * gain:
        * a better understanding how about fetch data from websites with python
        * will be more free to create its own solutions for scrapping data
        * a better undertanding about structured and non-structured formats, HTML, XML, free form text and how deal with each kind of those formats
* 
    * My learner has STEM background, is about to work with simulations and comes to the workshop to get some specific knowledge to use it for their work.
    * They have interest/motivation to follow the workshop.

* 
  * Students have no relevant knowledge or experience in Unix Shell.
  * They want to learn something but not planning to solve some problems.
  * They will probably learn some basic knowledge but they will forget quickly. (Obliviate charm)
   
* 
    * The learner could be from any background with little to no knowledge about the topic, and had a struggle to know where to start from. Therefore we have to make sure we have a well structured flow of materials that allow them to get the basics as they need to accomplish goals of the tutorial.  
* 
    * Some may have followed a tutorial, some may not have any experience with the topic
    * Perspective of the observer of a product is biased compared with the perspective of a maker
    * Highly motivated to apply the knowledge in current projects
* 
    * If a workshop is computational biology focussed and the learner comes with no computing skills, the learner faces the challenge of learning the computing skills before jumping onto developing skills in genomics.
    * The workshop I deliver will help the learner develop the skills in both domains: computing and genomics.
    * The workshop focusses on inclusive environment.
    * Also, the workshop provides the learner to work on actual biological data which is more intuitive.


### Exercise: Evaluate Learning Objectives (10 min)
- Select one learning objective from the episode you‚Äôve used for teaching practice. - - Copy it into the etherpad then add numbers below your objective to address the following:
- Write your learning objective in the pad.
- Suppose a learner had mastered this objective, and wanted to try something more cognitively challenging on the exact same topic (i.e. not a next step in a workflow). 
- Identify an objective they could work towards next.
- Suppose a learner struggled to meet the specified objective. What might they be missing? Identify one more fundamental thing a learner needs to be able to do in order to be successful in meeting this objective.

‚åõ until 12:08

* 
    1. Original objective: Convert between strings and factors.
    2. More challenging objective: Create categorical variables from numerical variables (after the original objective)
    3. Fundamental: Display the type of variables (before the original objective)
* 
    1. Successfully import data into OpenRefine
    2. Trying out other options on the Import screen and how they influence the preview. Try out importing other formats (e.g. JSON, XML)
    3. Learners might have problems navigating the file system to find the file they have downloaded for manipulation in OpenRefine.
* 
    1. Use commands to print and view files and parts of files
    2. Use loops to execute the commands with the same parameters on different files
    3. Get acquainted with data and folder structure
* 
  1. Correctly write `for` loops to repeat simple calculations
  2. Writing `for` loop which applies sequence of calculations which depend on previous loop iterations - for example summing a sequence of numbers or finding the maximum
  3. A learner might struggle with understanding the syntax of writing a loop in Python - for example use of an indented block to represent the loop body. To meet the objective they may need to identify the difference in behaviour for statements which appear within the indented loop body and those who follow the loop but are not indented. 
* 
    1. Adding/removing column into/from data frame in R. Merging two data frames in R. 
    2. Practice by adding new rows to the new data frame/ adding more than two data frames into single data frame.
    3. A learner might be confusing with the term of data frame e.g. which one is rows or columns.

* 
    1. Create a directory hierarchy that matches a given diagram.
    2. View structure using tree
    3. Revisit basic movement commands (cd / ls)
* 
    Objective Using Open Refine; What are facets  and how are they used to sort and summarise data
    * learners may have difficulty navigating the drop down menu 
    * Or identifying the right variable 
    * Great familiarity and time spent in the dashboard will help
* 
    * Objective: Assign values to variables. (Python fundamentals)
        * Where to go next: perform operations using variables | test out variable name limitations in Python | perform operations between different type variables (i.e., string + integer, and figure out *why* they can't)
        * If they're struggling: help them understand the concept of *memory* (i.e., the ability to store a value -- using an analogy, for example a filing cabinet if necessary), and how a *variable* can help retrieve the value from memory (i.e., rather than having to check the entire filing cabinet, you just look for the one with the correct label); 
* 
    * Objective: Write a query to select all values for specific fields from a single table.
        1. Select not all Values, but restrict rows as well 
        1. where quant is rad in Survey, get the mean of reading
        1. Most likely will have a problem with table / record / field distinction - shortly revisit basics
* 
    *    Learning objective: "Create a directory hierarchy that matches a given diagram" from https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/index.html
    A more challenging concept withing the context of directory hierarchy is to create symbolic links
    If a learner fails to meet the objective of creating a directory hierarchy this may be due to lack of understanding of the concept of directories and trees so this should be explained

* 
    * 1. Load external data from a .csv file into a data frame
    * 2. Try downloading another dataset, e.g. from https://r-dir.com/reference/datasets.html
    * 3. They may not know how to create files/directories - get them to try to create a file/directory with a specific name only using R (e.g. dir.create)
* 
* 
    * Objective: Create a directory hierarchy that matches a given diagram.
        * 1. Create 2 or more new directories on totally diferent locations (not in current directory) in fylesystem in a single shot
        * 2. Let's say the objetive to learn this is the creation of a folder named as "Papers" inside each user HOME
        * 3. The learner is strugling on directory creation due missing right permissions on the parent folder
        * 4. Fundamental thing missing is some knowledge about file and folder permissions and how to change write permissions
* 
    1. Learning objective: Work with files and directories from the command line
    2. More advanced objective: create multiple directories (nested) with one command
    3. Struggling learner: they may be missing the basics on the structure of directories, probably because they are more used to actually seeing directory structures via a GUI for example.
* 
  * Shell script
    * How to write
    * How to debug
    * How to execute it
  * The student writes a batch script to submit his own jobs to the cluster.

* 
    * Learning objective: Describe what a DataFrame is in Python
    * Advanced learner: Could move on with reaching, listing the data in the DataFrame and visualisation of the data
    * Novice learner: They might be challenged with teh concept of dataframe and why they are useful other than using simple built in Python arrays. Therefore they would need to understand additional benefits of using particular packages and their functionalities in standardizing and facilitating the data manipulations.
    * 
* 
    * Learning Objective: Load external data from a .csv file into a data frame.
    * Next step (objective): Load external data from .csv (.txt) files using different convensions
    * Challenges: If .csv files have been always diplayed in a spreadsheet application, the learner may not be aware about the format of the data and will have difficulties to understand the different options in the reading function.

* 
    * Learning Objectives:
        * Functions in Python: 
            * 1) Basic Objective: Learning about Functions and how to create functions and define them.
            * 2) Advanced objective: Creating multiple functions in a script and working on to create a simple calculator.

### Exercise: Where are your Checkpoints? (5 min)
Have a look at your learning objective again and identify where in the lesson that objective should reasonably be achieved.

* 
    * At the end of the lesson each participants should have achieved the learning objective (which also is a prerequistie for the next episode)
* 
    * At the end of the section "Reading files"
* 
  * Objective: Correctly write `for` loops to repeat simple calculations.
  * Checkpoint: After worked example introducing general structure of a loop in Python or potentially after related exercises (_Understanding the loops_ or _From 1 to N_).
* 
    * Objective: Add column into data frame
    * Checkpoint: After showing the dataframe with the additional column. 
* 
    * Objective: Create a directory hierarchy that matches a given diagram.
    * Checkpoint before starting to make directories
* 
    * Objective using facets in Open Refine
    * checkpoint: at the end of the activity used to demonstrate this feature
* 
* 
    * Objective: Assign values to variables
    * Where the objective should be achieved: Can be tested at different points -- immediately following its introduction, to understand whether the assignment operator (=) was understood, then to understand reassignment, then to understand data types, but at the end is the best place to find whether the objective has been fully achieved (it is a very short episode).
* 
    *    Learning objective: "Create a directory hierarchy that matches a given diagram" from https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/index.html
    *    Students should be able to achieve the objective earlier on in the lesson because this skill is required later on.
    
* 
    * LO: Load external data from a .csv file into a data frame
    * Checkpoint: Should be achieved before progressing with rest of lesson, as builds on downloaded dataset; checkpoint is 1) when learners see file on their local system, and 2) when they can view the dataset within R as a data frame
 
* 
    * Checkpoint is when the learner see the folder created, if the list files command was properly learned, then the link both list and create will make magic happen
* 
    * Learning objective: Work with files and directories from the command line
    * It should be achieved after learners are shown how to do it (live coding) and after they have practiced it on their own (typing along the instructor)

* 
    * For understanding the data frame and its facilitatory effect in data handling, learners would see in comperative examples (e.g. handling the data in an excel, array vs a dataframe). Similarly when they play with the additional functionalities the package provides they would be able to grasp the concept better.
* 
    * In my selected lesson, reading data is handled at the very beginning. If I consider the expanded objective, I may move it more to the end and focus first on the work with data (e.g. by using pre-installed examples) and than discuss the different formats to read.
* 
    * Once the learner has learned to create variables, data structures, data types, conditional statements. 
    * Learners also know the control structures and indentations as well as printing.
    * Leaner is then ready to learn the concepts of functions and defining them in Python.
    * Learner can use basic examples to learn this objective.

# Exercise: Assessment is for Everyone (10 min)
How might you apply formative assessment to:
a) verify that that achievement has been met by all and
b) make learners aware of their accomplishment?
Keep in mind that formative assessment can take many forms, including multiple choice questions, other exercises, spontaneous questions and calls for sticky notes. Discuss some thoughts about this process in groups and write some notes in the pad.
This exercise and discussion should take about 10 minutes.

‚åõ Until 12:27

Room 1 
* Verification: Post-its/Zoom reactions; helpers checks
* Tools such as Socrative for exercises which are multiple choice questions - using instructor view can get feedback on how many students answering and proportion giving each response
* Tools for getting continuous feedback such as Zoom reactions (for example asking participants to give green tick reaction if they are comfortable with material covered in last section and red cross otherwise) or https://cups.fast.ai/
* Group coding on exercise in breakout rooms (or in person) with one participant sharing screen and typing and other participants directing

Room 2 
* For Adrian's episode it would just suffice to ask whether people have the procejt imported and can proceed with the next step
* The kind of formative assessment depends on the number of participants. If there are only 5-6 people you won't need Mentimeter or similar tools but just can ask and walk around to see the actual process and talk to people.
* For Aoifes lesson, a check in using a poll at the end of the section could be useful in the case of students or if its staff a group discussion might be more appropriate. 
* For Jan's session, do a quick poll recapping terminology - "in this query command, what is 'personal' - table / record / field"

Room 3 
* Challenges in every Carpentries' lesson materials are well-written with access to solutions.
* I would ask students to do all challenges after each section I teach.
* Check the screens in live sessions (check if the people follow the session).

Room 4 

* Giving additional room/assignment to reinforce the objective. 
* Once the learning accomplished with a stage we can encourage them to move on with the next stage to acknowledge their accomplishment and continue to build upon


Room 5 
* For example, creating an analogous exercise to what has just been demonstrated - i.e., if they've been shown how to create a directory and copy a file there, they can do the same with another folder and file
* Ask users to predict what will happen when given the initial part of a hypotethical scenario
* Quizzes
* Multiple choice works with a small number of people because instructor can ask participants to justify their decision. In large numbers it can allow people to get the correct answer by answering randomly, though might also reveal common misunderstandings if a large proportion chooses the same wrong answer
* introduce errors on purpose to test specific rules (i.e., after explaining the rules of variable naming in python, try to create a variable that violates those rules)
    
Room 6 
- LO : Load external data from a .csv file into a data frame
    - Multiple choice question (maybe not multiple choice - should be very doable anyway) 
        - How many columns are there in the data set
        - What is the value of the x^{th} row and y^{th} column (restricted to those values you can see through head())
- I would do a multiple choices question asking about creation of directories
    - Objective: Create a directory hierarchy that matches a given diagram.
    - Question: Given the following commands:
        - `cd /tmp`
        - `mkdir datasets`
    - What will be the results if the commands are typed in the correct order?
        - a) the directory /tmp will be created
        - b) the file named as 'datasets' is created
        - c) the new directory 'datasets' is created
        - d) the file 'tmp/datasets' is created
        - e) none of the alternatives above

### How Frequent?
Formative assessments of some kind should ideally be used every 5 minutes and at least every 10-15 minutes
"Do You Understand" is ineffective as formative assesment

### Prepare to Cut
Keep breaks on time
Watch out for dependencies
Leave time to wrap up your workshop
Do not speed up
Communicate with your team
Communicate with your learners

### Keypoints:
- To teach effectively, you have to know *who* you are teaching.
- Good learning objectives identify specific events that can be evaluated through formative assessment.
- A good exercise informs Learners and Instructors when an objective is achieved.

## üç± Lunch break, back at 13:30

Minute Cards: https://forms.gle/FromLEgwEFuddPbXA

## More Practice Live Coding
Questions:
- How did you change your teaching in response to feedback?
Objectives:
- Use feedback to improve your teaching.

### Exercise: Teaching demo rubric (10 min)
- Before splitting into groups, read the rubric that is given to Instructor Trainers as a suggested framework for evaluating the online teaching demonstration sessions that are part of Instructor checkout.
https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demos_rubric/ . (Note: demos are not scored, so this rubric is for advisory purposes only.) What questions do you have?

Room 1 

Room 2 
 
Room 3 
   * Mirrors the learner‚Äôs environment 
       * Computer lab vs. work with own laptops
       * It is difficult to mirror exactly the same environment when learners have different operating systems.

Room 4 
No questions

Room 5 

Room 6 
* what constitutes a 'deviation'?

### Exercise live coding round 2 (30 min)
- Return to your groups and repeat the previous live coding exercise, re-teaching the same content as before. This time, the presenter should incorporate changes based on feedback received, and everyone should try to ‚Äòlevel up‚Äô their feedback using the rubric for teaching demos.
- When you are finished, add some thoughts on this process to the Etherpad: What did you change? Did it work better or worse with the change? How might you do it if you were to teach it again?

Back at 2:22 pm

    - Changes worked well, clarifying potential sources of confusion from the first time round
    - If doing again, would click on created folder on desktop
- 
    - Avoid start from a folder with lots of strange temp files, good point

After you're back
- This exercise should take about 10 minutes for rubric discussion, 25 minutes for teaching, and 10 minutes for de-brief.

### Keypoints:
- (Reflective) Practice makes perfect.

## Working With Your Team
Questions:
- What are the challenges of managing a heterogeneous classroom?
- What should we do if there is a Code of Conduct violation?
- What does it mean to be a co-Instructor?
- How does an instructional team prepare for a workshop?
    
Objectives:
- Identify potential challenges of teaching learners with very different backgrounds and skill levels.
- Locate resources to direct your response if someone at your workshop violates the Code of Conduct.
- Identify workshop roles and responsibilities for your team.
- Use The Carpentries workshop website template instructions to start creating a website.

**Never Teach Alone**

The Instructional Team
- A Host who organizes the workshop logistics
- Two or more Instructors who plan and execute workshop instruction
- Helpers who support learners during the workshop

Hosting
https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/hosts_instructors_checklist.html#host-checklist

Helpers
- help learners with setup and installation
- answer questions during exercises
- monitor the room to spot people who may need help (indicated by a sticky note or otherwise)
- monitor the shared notes and either answer questions there or remind the Instructor to do so during breaks
https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/hosts_instructors_checklist.html#helper-checklist

### Carpentries Classroom Practices
- Starting with the Code of Conduct
- Participatory Instruction & Hands-off Help
    - Learners Use Their Own Machines
- Sticky Notes
    - Accessibility of Sticky Notes
- Formative Assessment
- Breaks (ideally with snacks)
- Feedback

### Co-Teaching Models
- Team teaching: Both teachers deliver a single stream of content in tandem, taking turns the way that musicians taking solos would.
- Teach and assist: Teacher A teaches while Teacher B moves around the classroom to help learners.

### Sticky Situations 1: Learners at Many Levels

### Exercise: What Are the Challenges? (10 min)
- What are some of the challenges you might expect when teaching learners with a broad range of expertise? Add your thoughts in the Etherpad.

Room 1 

  * Participants with more experience already can get frustrated when not encountering new material
  * Having mixed group can also lead to spontaneous opportunities for peer teaching - more difficult online
  * Easy to get side-tracked by technical questions from more experienced participants - need to consciously aim to stay on track in main teaching session and for example respond to such queries in breaks or outside of main class time
  * Need to ensure that less experienced participants do not feel reluctant to answer questions due to fear of holding rest of class back
  * Easier to be handled in presence vs. online sessions
  * Providing additional exercises for advanced participants

Room 2 
- People who already know the basics might get bored.
- People with zero experience might be frustrated/demotivated.
- Some people may be more vocal and take over the discussion while others stay silent all the time.
- A person become rude or offensive towards participant or instructors
- PHD students might be silent if a professor is also present

Room 3 
- Publish learner profile in advance
- Publish course material in advance
- Pay (individual?) attention to struggling learners
- Use course material challenges to occupy high achivers
- Ask high achivers to contribute describing their approach

Room 4 
- Good to know the level of students beforehand, and ensure that they all meet the minimum criteria
- It is not always possible to know the level of students beforehand if self-assessed.
- Students may fall behind 
- If some are left behind there is a lot of extra work for instructors and/or helpers
- It may be difficult to find examples that are relevant to people with different professional or cultural backgrounds.
- Examples can be obstacles in certain circumstances

Room 5

- Questions that do not fit the curriculum at this point in time and will not be touched upon
- Differentially expert students trying to steer course towards own interest
- Losing interest of advance students - pace-setting generally
- For instructor, adjusting on fly can be quite difficult, especially if unexperienced

Room 6 
  - Learners will usually fall behind during the teaching when broad range of topics are being taught
  - If helper exists, they can spend extra care/help for the learner
- workshop advertising
- exercises
- partnering
- managing the conversation
- helper vigilance

### Sticky Situations 2: Code of Conduct Violations

A critical function of the Code of Conduct is to ensure that our community does not tolerate or encourage the persistence of harmful behaviors. In order for the code to work well, incidents must be reported. Note that it is not the responsibility of the reporter to determine whether a Code of Conduct violation has occurred; when in doubt, it is best to report an incident and allow the Code of Conduct Committee to make that determination.

### Exercise: Know Your Resources -- --

1) Take 5 minutes to read through the Code of Conduct Incident Response Guidelines: https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/incident-response.html 

2) Discuss what you have read in small groups. As questions arise, you may wish to refer to our complete Code of Conduct section in The Carpentries Handbook: https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/index_coc.html or to the Transparency Reports released by The Carpentries Code of Conduct Committee: https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/tree/master/code-of-conduct-transparency-reports

What kinds of things could your instructional team agree upon in advance of your workshop?
What questions do you have about CoC enforcement?

3) Write some notes in the Etherpad.

Room 1 

* How do we assess the level of threat ?
* The threat level should be specified in the Incident Report Form.

Room 2

Room 3

Room 4 

* What if you don't witness a situation but get noticed about by someone?
* It is a hard exercise, because you expect not to experience such situations, on the other hand, you need to be prepared to take action immediatly.

Room 5

Room 6

### Workshop website template:
https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template

Keypoints:
- Team work takes work, but allows you to share the load and build connections.
- Working with a broad range of learners can be challenging, but there are many ways to keep a classroom happy and motivated.
- The instructional team decides how to respond to Code-of-Conduct incidents during a workshop; all violations should be reported to The Carpentries Code of Conduct committee for follow-up.

‚òï Break until 3:40 pm

## Launches and Landings
Questions:
- How do you actually start a workshop?

Objectives:
- Connect goals of an introduction with options for content and delivery.
- Practice a short introduction.
- Identify worthwhile elements of a workshop conclusion.

### Launching your Workshop: The Introduction

*"primacy effect"*:  a tendency to remember things presented at the beginning of a list or event

### Exercise: What is in an Introduction? (10 min)
Get into small groups and discuss the questions below. Take notes on your answers in the Etherpad.
What do you hope to accomplish in a workshop introduction?
What information do you need to include in an introduction to accomplish these goals?
After 5 minutes, come together, and combine ideas as a large group.

room 1
*    make the objectives clear, in layman terms: by the end of the workshop you will be able to import a spreadsheet into R and make whatever analysis you want on it
*    Give the learners an opportunity to get in tune with the room
*    Give time for people to settle in and adjust to what the workshop is going to be
*    Take a minute to clarify terms that might come up a lot (jargon-busting)

room 2
* Introducing ourselves
* Setting the plan for the day
* Setting the tone
* Introductions for all
* "Breaking the ice"
* Setting expectations

room 3

- introduce yourself + ice breaker
- invite engagement: to contact the helpers, ask questions, give feedback
- make clear that everybody is hear to learn, also the instructors who are happy about feedback
- invite feedback and communication

room 6 
* Introduction of what to expect from the context/lecture
* Technical Details (if not planed in advance)
 * Going through the schedule and content of the event (outline)
 * Instructions about the room/buildng usage
 * Introduction of helpers, the instructor
 * Housekeeping details help the instructor
 * Introduction of Code of Conduct and violation handling

---

Finally, compare your ideas with the list of topics below. Did you miss anything? Did you come up with something that is not listed below?

* Set positive first impressions
* Introduce yourself effectively (and have other workshop leaders do the same)
* Clarify learning objectives and expectations
* Help learners learn about each other
* Set the tone for the workshop
* Collect baseline data on learners‚Äô knowledge and motivation
* Whet learners‚Äô appetite for workshop content
* Inform Learners of Logistics

### Setting the Stage
attire
physical environment
time before class
introducing yourself
introductions for everyone
doubts
seeding a classroom community
icebreakers

### Teaching Your Trajectory: Workshop 101
- Describe the prerequisites (if any).
- Share the schedule and logistics
- Communicate the workshop structure

    - how to follow the Code of Conduct
    - ways to ask for help
    - ways to give feedback to the instructional team
- Collect and share baseline data on learners
- Share some advice for success
- Whet learners‚Äô appetites for workshop content

### Exercise: Practice Your Introduction (15 min)
Imagine you have completed instructor training and you are about to teach a full lesson around the material you have been practicing teaching today.
- Write out some notes, covering a few of the topics described above:
    - Introduce yourself effectively
    - Clarify learning objectives and expectations
    - Set the tone for the workshop
- Return to your groups of 2 or 3 and each give 2 minutes of your introduction. (5-6 min)
- After each introduction, briefly share feedback, reserving extensive discussion for after all have had a turn to present.

Room 1 

* remembering to keep a reasonable pace and to breathe!

room 2 

room 3 
* Set some realistic expectations for learners
* Ensure that there is a friendly environment set from the beginning
* Relate with learners with an example if possible (eg. on a git workshop mention that we have all created copies of code to keep different versions, module_XX_1, module_XX_2, etc..., so in this workshop we will learn the tools to avoid such situations!)
* Briefly talk about the Code of Conduct
* Introduction of participants is also important

room 4 

room 5 

* Good structure and clear expectations set
* Highly experienced in presenting workshops, it is noticeable that he has plenty of practice
* Well strucutred, will engage students, fun analogies that will draw people in, great greeting in beginning

room 6 
* Nice introduction and a quick overview. 
* Mentioned about the CoC which is really important.
* Having introductions of everyone is also important.

## The Art of a Smooth Landing

- End the workhop in time
- Do not try to squeeze the remainin content
- Leave enogh time for closing

### Keypoints:
- A planned introduction is key to creating a functional workshop environment.
 - Conclusions support reflective practice and set the stage for continued learning.

## Putting It Together
Questions:
