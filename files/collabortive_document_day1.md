## üß† Collaborative Notes & üîß Exercises

### Exercise: Reviewing The Carpentries Experience and Goal

For the multiple choice questions below, please place an ‚ÄúX‚Äù next to the response(s) that best apply to you. Then find yourself a spot in the Etherpad below to write a short response to the last question

1) Have you ever participated in a Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, or Library Carpentry Workshop?

* Yes, I have taken a workshop. XXXX
* Yes, I have been a workshop helper. XXXXX
* Yes, I organized a workshop.
* No, but I am familiar with what is taught at a workshop. XXXXXXX
* No, and I am not familiar with what is taught at a workshop.
* Not yet. I was adviced about via Slack.
 
2) Which of these most accurately describes your teaching experience?

* I have been a graduate or undergraduate teaching assistant for a university/college course. XXXXXXXXXXX
* I have not had any teaching experience in the past. XX
* I have taught a seminar, workshop, or other short or informal course.XXXXXXX
* I have been the instructor-of-record for my own university/college course. XXX
* I have taught at the primary or secondary education level. X
* I have taught informally through outreach programs, hackathons, libraries, laboratory demonstrations, and similar activities. XXXXXX
 
3) Why are you taking this course? What goals do you have for today and tomorrow?

- Improve my ability to teach coding, specifically teaching bioinformatics to wetlab scientists (MC).

To improve my teaching skills.

To improve my pedagogical techniques in teaching people how to code  (and best practices) -- (and also to get certified as a carpentries instructor, to help organise workshops at my institution)

Get a better understanding of the learning process and effective strategies for helping students get the most out of courses, both Carpentries and other similar programming related courses that I help to teach.

I would like to be able to deliver carpentries courses to researchers an students in my college. 
To be able to give Carpentries courses within my institution.

To be able to teach. 
I would like to (a) improve my teaching practice, (b) learn how to best teach coding since I learnt coding mainly on my own (self-taught), (c) be able to organise and teach Carpentries workshops
FA: I want to build on my basic understanding of teaching and training so I can train staff and students how to make the most of the high-performance computing systems available to them. My immediate goals are to learn how to structure and deliver the content of the carpentries syllabus and use it as a foundation to deliver other courses.

Improve my teaching skills and my didactical understanding. Do a OpenRefine course later in combination with an introduction to the reconciliation endpoint we provide (see [here](https://slides.lobid.org/2021-kim-reconcile/) for German slides of this introduction). Maybe create a Carpentry session with others at some point.

My line-manager asked me to do this.

Improve teaching skills somewhat, get to know the carpentries, in the future maybe assist to teach / develop some courses to assist researchers migrating to better software development practices.

Obtain a skill set in teaching in open settings to audience/students from any background and get the qualification to teach under Carpentries community.  

Improve my teaching skills, in order to organize workshops on the lab I am working on.

To help my group to teach programming best practice to staff and students at our University

I have never teaching, but I would like to learn to do local courses (TRG).

To improve my teaching skills, especially regarding data management.

### Exercise: Anticipating Misconceptions

Describe a misconception you have encountered as a teacher or as a learner.
This exercise should take about 5 minutes.
 
Using Formative Assessment to Identify Misconceptions
How can you prevent hidden misconceptions from interfering with learning? Seek them out with assessment!

* 
    * When I was first tought how to do PCRs, I had a misconceptions about how to "read" the results. This was resolved when a colleague asked me about an experiment and I realised I was missing pieces of information to fully understand and interprete the results.
* 
    * I thought I could expect from learners a basic knowledge of how the web works (What is a URL?).
    * A related misconception I had for a long time is that other people know what is strongly anchored knowledge for myself.
* 
    * For research data to be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Accessible), they have to be made Open Access.
* 
    * A common misconception I have encountered when teaching programming is that variable names have meaning to the computer rather than just us as coders. There are also commonly 'false friends' in programming languages where a pattern which applies in one context and might be sensibly thought to apply in another similar context but doesn't - for example scoping of variables within blocks in Python versus in functions.
* 
    * When I was teaching ML course as in TA, some students evaluate the model based on training error rather than test/validation error.
* 
    * Attempting to demonstrate photoluminescence in a laboratory, I tried to use a Silicon wafer as a makeshift sample. This proved impossible (with the equipment we had) as Silicon has an indirect band gap. My misconception confused the people I was attempting to teach.
* 
    * I have found that there are many misconceptions around FAIR and Open Data. The assumption they make is that to have FAIR data it must be Open. Or that to share  data or have Open Data it must be fully machine readable when this is not yet possible for all types of research data/ all disciplines. 
* 
    * From a different domain but, when I was teaching literary studies, I found that many students assumed that texts are fixed rather than mutable historical objects -- for example, 'To be or not to be' was a very different speech in its first publication
* 
    * A model coincidence detector does not detect a coincence, but if two events coincide in time - mismatch of verbage used day-to-day vs subject-specific terminology
* 
    * Perhaps the concept of division by zero. As a child my teacher said that the result of diviing any number > 0 by 0 is 0 but later on in secondary school the mathematics teacher demonstrated that the result of dividing a number > 0 by 0 is not defined.
    * Another example I found is that some do not establish the difference between 0 and null in computing. 
* 
    * As a teacher (and as a student a few more years prior), p-values and significance. When explaining what they mean, usually encounter a few mismappings in mental models.
* 
   * As a student: The Explanation of a very specific topic (non-programmatic course) to a class of novice students.
* 
    * Before reading this workshop references I tought each studant has its own way of learning, like the left-side brain of thinking VS right-side brain.
    * Opening a project as free foftware / open source does not mean that the project will start receiving tons of contributions immediately.
* 
    * As a lab demonstrator in Physics, I found that it was tricky to explain the concepts of uncertainty in measurements since a measurement is not just a value with absolute certainty, there is an error on it.
    * As a student, it took me some time to understand the difference between local and global variables
* 
    * Not in teaching software but during the CFD practice session, students who are not familiar with certain terminology will always be confused when hearing some technical terms.
* 
    * Misconception from students are usually regarding their thoughts on one model applies to all. However every individual is different and there is no single recipie for learning. 
    * From my experiences, learning requires an effort and deep focus, and productive thinking that allows seeing the picture outside of its box and applicability of the learnt skill to the other areas and domains. Otherwise if we stick with the closed insight, intactness of the learning remains more superficial.
* 
    * By teaching R, I assumed "methods" to be a common way for object oriented programming language (a function behave different for different objects).
    * Now I (believe to) know, it is more than that, R has different ways to approach it, which are not necessary perfect. to approach it, which are not necessary perfect. to approach it, which are not necessary perfect., R has different ways, R has different ways, R has different ways, R has different ways, R has different ways, R has different ways, R has different ways, R has different ways, R has different ways, R has different ways

### Exercise: Formative Assessments

Any instructional tool that generates feedback that is used in a formative way can be described as ‚Äúformative assessment.‚Äù Based on your previous educational experience (or even this training so far!) what types of formative assessments do you know about?
Write your answers in the Etherpad; or go around and have each person in the group name one.

* 
    * Ask to re-explain/re-formulate/repeat with another example
    * find analogies and examples
* 
    * feedback questionaire
    * polls (with mentimeter, in a pad like here etc.)
    * q&a sessions

    * Couching sessions: Every participant apply learned topics in own projects, the trainer is available for support

### Exercise: What Is An Expert?

What is something that you are an expert in? How does your experience when you are acting as an expert differ from when you are not an expert?

* 
    * I do not feel like an expert in anything really. Maybe, I would say I am an expert at making buttercream, which involves a several very technical steps (including making a sirup). It took me many attempts to get it right, and now I nearly always get it right, and if not I would know right away what went wrong, and I can use this as a basis for more other icing and food preps :)
* 
    * I am an expert in: data modeling for the web, especially for library-related data
    * My experience differs: I have already done a lot of mistakes myself and can anticipate them in others' work; I know where to look stuff up or who to ask when I am stuck
* 
    * Research Data Management
    * When acting as an expert, I answer questions and create content. When not an expert, I ask questions and benefit from the content created by others.
* 
    * Walking on steep slopes / rough ground. Being able to judge when a foot placement will be able to hold without slipping or not and being able to quickly scan an and assess the best places to tread. Partly based on having sufficiently accurate mental models to make reasonable judgements quickly but also having the confidence of how to deal with misjudgements having made mistakes a lot of times.
    * Programming in Python. Expertise partly based on having sufficient knowledge to be able to plan out how to break down a problem in to appropriate subproblems and map these to language constructs, but also in large part about being able to search effectively to find existing solutions and deal with error messages and bugs! Having the confidence to try things and iterate.
* 
    * Machine learning application in omics dataset  & analyzing the omics data.
    * I am able to grasp the almost every detail and I am quite fast when/if troubleshooting is needed. When I am not expert, I can not catch the subtlety.
* 
    * Given time and support from subject matter experts, I think I can be an expert problem solver. When acting as an (ignorant) expert in this manner, I find I am able to abstract problems and come up with abstract solutions which can be translated into practical solutions by the subject matter expert. When I am not acting as an expert, tasks take me much longer and I find it hard to produce best practice results.
* 
    * Research Data management
    * As an expert I can put questions on RDM in context and see the bigger picture. This means that I can address questions on RDM from multiple disciplines and on a wide range of project. When I am out of my comfort zone it can be difficult to contextualise the information and know how to answer questions posed. Or even see how it relates to my area of expertise. 
    * Also in my role I am expected to provide support to  a wide range of disciplines so I am very good at identifying  what I don't know but also knowing where to find the answers.  
* 
    * I don't *feel* like an expert in anything, but technically I'm certified as an expert in early modern literature and digital humanities (i.e., have a PhD) -- the difference when I am acting as an expert, I think, is that in that position I am more confident in both the things I know but also in admitting the things I don't know -- and confident that I can learn those new things if I need to.
* 
    * Cognitive animal training: Infer animal behavioral processes based on small markers that might go unnoticed to novices, extrapolate from smaller+larger behavioral markers to adapt training parameters in a goal-oriented way.
* 
    * I am an expert in managing Unix servers so I can easily determine the likely cause of a malfunction and offer advice to most users. However, when working on new systems I have to step back and let someone else to take the lead.
* 
    * Single-cell Analysis/Mathematical Biology
    * When I am an expert in something, wrt learning, I am better aware of 'edges' I may be missing in my model, and can search them out. When I am not acting as an expert, I am not even sure what are the concepts, the nodes in the mental model - I have to read much more broadly to answer any given question.
* 
    * The expert has considerable skill and competence. But, we always have to learn new things.
    * Cited Niles Bohr: ‚ÄùAn expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.‚Äù 
    * I am expert in disassembling and reassembling the PC, analysis of genomic/trascriptomic data.......jokes :).
* 
    * Software Engineer
    * As an expert today I design the most simple solution instead of a generic and flexible solution, later if needed the solution can be refactored to be more "configurable". Avoid "over engineering".
* 
    * I don't feel an expert in a field, even though I have extensive experience in a few, rather specific, topics (Matlab for simulations, using HPC efficiently, optimizing code, Python coding to post-process huge data (~100GB)). There is always something that will catch me off-guard and I'll have to do a search to find the answer.
    * For the topics I feel comfortable, I rely on my problem solving skills to find the answer, or explain to someone how to approach their particular problem.
* 
    * Mechanical engineering; CFD simulation in transonic aerodynamics and hydrodynamics; engineering optimisation.
    * As an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù, I would spend a decent amount of time thinking about the research problems and discussing with my colleagues before starting any specific tasks, i.e., project management. I'm also more pragmatic. 
* 
    * Pure Mathematics & Brain networks
    * When I teach, since I love what I do and enjoy the topics I am learning & teaching. In both cases I try to make as simple and applicable to the daily life to make the examples concerete and as simple enough to break the initial bias and fear regarding the complexity of the topics to  increase their appealing to see how further each toic could be carried away. Hence I try to create a vision that allows myself/ the learner to find a way to apply the learnt skill to engage more.  
* 
    * R-Programming, GIS, vegetationl ecology
    * I use to spend more time preparing a workshop if I am not an expert, while I may underestimate the required time if I am an expert (I know, a bad practice :worried:). As expert, I can also improvise better.
* 
    * Expert in R-Programming, Python, Shell programming, NGS data analysis, RNAseq analysis, scRNAseq analysis, ATACseq analysis, Bioinformatics app development, Web programming, Big data management. I feel comfortable teaching programming to postgraduate students and I have been teaching past 3 years to MSc Bioinformatics students. I am Module lead for Programming in Bioinformatics and Genetic Epidmiology group and Co-Lead for Protein Biology and Omics.

### Exercise: Awareness Gaps

1. Is there anything you are learning how to do right now? Can you identify something that you still need to think about, but your teacher can do without thinking about it?
1. Think about the area of expertise you identified for yourself earlier. What could a potential awareness gap be?

* 
    1. I am currently switching from microbiology to plant biology, and when analysing RNA-seq data, specific mecanisms (splicing) should be considered when studying plants, while these mecanisms are not found (or not as much) in microorganisms - this is something I had to figure out by myself as everyone else in my new workplace takes this as very basic/fundamental knowledge.
    2. About "my expertise", I know when the caramel is ready based on - what I perceive as - a very sharp change the smell, which tells me I must take the caramel off the heat. This can be overlooked and difficult to teach or explain if I was in the situation to teach someome.
* 
    1. I am learning how to transform a metadata set with Metafacture and [Metafacture-Fix](https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-fix/). I have no experience with creating simple dummy dummy workflows to try out the best approach for a transformation task. My colleague can just create them easily in a short amount of time at https://metafacture.org/playground
    2. When working with schema.org markup you must not be aware of the intricacies of Linked Open Data (e.g. I should have a URI thing I am talking about, I should clarify when I record information about a thing or its metadata)
* 
    1. Create a database. My teacher knows the right terms to search for answers on Google / Stackoverflow; I don't.
    2. That the concepts of research data and metadata, even if defined, are not so easy to grasp.
* 
    1. Learning to teach :). Knowing how to judge the correct level of detail to give on a topic. I find that experienced teachers are usually able to much more quickly judge how much detail is appropriate for a given group of learners, or when responding to a particular query, while I find I often tend to give overly long winded descriptions which can end up confusing people.
    2. _Awareness gaps_ when hillwalking with less experienced walkers - for example walking down a slope without realising it could prove challenging to someone who is less confident, or when climbing / scrambling pointing out hand or footholds which while potentially easily identifiable to myself are not obvious or perhaps not reachable to others.
* 
    1. I am learning SQLite to maintain data bases. Since I can not afford todedicate my entire time to learn due to deadlines of other projects, I might miss the theoretical part of it.
    2. My expertise is analyzing the omics data and sometimes I completely omit how the data is generated. 
* 
    1. Homebrewing beer - I cannot reliably produce nice tasting beer, unlike those who are teaching me. This is made up of lots of little tricks, mostly hard to learn unless watching someone go through the process themselves
    2. My expertise in problem solving is inherently limited, I am always learning new techniques for problem solving from colleagues and friends
* 
    1. I am learning about the European Open Science Cloud. In the training so far it's not yet clear how to engage with individual federated services whereas the trainers are very familiar with this and are focused on why we should and not the practical aspects of how too. I'm still not sure how to onboard researchers in my institution to EOSC. 
    2. I think sometimes its easy to assume that the research community are aware of Open Research and how it applies to them. But I need to remind myself everyday that it is a steep learning curve and not everyone is at the same point on that curve. Also Open Research is changing, funder requirements are changing, it can be hard for me to keep up, and its a core part of my role so it is doubly hard for researchers. 
* 
    1. I am learning a different language (well, have been for a while) -- even after many years, I still have trouble with choosing the correct article, but it is obvious to native speakers (de / het in dutch, if anyone is wondering)
    2. Doing digital humanities in general -- we often talk about data but humanists rarely mean structured data; and even when they mean structured data, the structure is widely different from one person to the next. When I ask for their data expecting a nice spreadsheet, I usually get back a word doc with a table (if I'm lucky).
* 
    1. Fixing my bike gear shift - I always assumed it's trivial, turns out it's not that easy. Something makes a weird noise. I tried debugging it step by step. A friend who knows his way around, found the underlying issue - the point where the gear shift attaches to the frame is bent. Didn't even cross my mind to check there.
    2. Potential awareness gap: New students need to become familiar with the animals and vice versa. Having worked a long time with them, it didn't cross my mind that they aren't comfortable around one another yet and thus can't work together.
* 
    1. I am learning how to manage a supercomputer and my instructor knows every corner of the system's interconnections and sometimes his explanations implicitly assumed familiarity with the topology of the system
    2. In my case I once made the incorrect assumption that users knew what a directory is within the context of showing them how to navigate a file system.  
* 
    1. How to be a data translator. One of the topics is how to extract project requirements from stakeholders with different personality types; the instuctors can adjust their style on the fly and extract the requirements without ruffling any feathers.
    2. In single-cell analysis, I focus on unsupervised clustering: I find it obvious that unsupervised clustering is not unbiased - you have specified a specific cost function - but this is nuance that is non-obvious and I find myself forgetting to explain.
* 
    * I am learning to use the software for analysis of molecular clock of Amaranthaceae speciation,  I have not familiarities
* 
    * I am learning French
    * I have to think about "past tense", "present tense", what is a "verb", "noum" etc all the time :P
    * About my expertise on "software engineering", awareness gap: the importance of automated tests, sometimes it is hard to see the real benefits.
* 
    * Learning how to use a new DFT software
    * I'm getting started with a new programming language (C++)
    * Learning further OpenACC
    * When explaining to my colleagues some piece of code, I tend to skip "obvious" things like defining and initializing variables, counters, etc... 
* 
   1. Not at this moment.
   2. In previous experience when teaching CFD, I sometimes forgot to introduce some "potentially important" steps in eiter pre-processing or post-processing to my students as I was very familiar with them but my students were not, and that caused some confusion.
* 
    * I am learning project management and team building for a software project I am leading. That requires balanced delegation of the roles among the team members to make sure everyone from any background and skillset could find a role to contribute to the project which my mentors have good amount of experiences from their eearlier projects.
    * Balancing between time management for task deadlines and creating an equal enviroment that would  not pressurise anyone more than what they are capable of. In academic life this could be relatively easier given the timeline of the projects however in software development life cycle it requres efficient use and management of the resources that I am learning atm. 
* 
    * I started some tutorials on node.js (plus JavaScript) and Docker.
    * In both cases (and some others) I was missing a very basic example (a standalone, running process) that can be expanded during the learnig process and had the impression, the explanations were relaying on a pre-knowledge.
    * In my own case, I have been advised, although most of the time regarding a missing example from "real life".
* 
    * I am learning about the advanced skills in Python and app development. Also analysing ATACseq and scATACseq data analysis and learning how to integrate data. 
    * I am also learning how to develop Web applications using R Shiny and have myself hosted an application using a Virtual Machine. I dont really know how this process of hosting on the VM works using Docker or Singularity, but I very much like to learn how to do it. Therefore, I am learning the process of developing containerised applications.

### Exercise: Diagnosis (until 11:23)

What is an error message that you encounter frequently in your work? (These are often syntax errors.)

Take a few minutes to plan out how you would explain that error message to your learners. Write the error and your explanation in the Collaborative Document.

    * it is hard to identify a frequent error message once every day is diferent, but usually errors related to missing packages, missing commands, etc
    * mostly the errors encountered due to the differences betweeen the used operating systems, dependencies, differences between the package versions the other tools relies on which creates difficulty to create a homogenous experiences for all. 
* room 3  :
    * type / name errors (misspellings)
        * easy to explain once they're identified
        * sometimes harder to identify if running a whole script and traceback is not understood --> see below
    * index errors [0/1] depending on language
        * explaining conventions of specific language
    * warnings mistaken for errors
        * pre-prepare code to be able to identify potential warnings
        * There is also an option in **knitr** to show errors in tutorials as explained [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/opts-error.html)
    * interpreting tracebacks
        * explain what traceback is, follow traceback with students (using pdb for example)
    * compilation errors
        * check the error and read the documents
* room 4 :
    * R: *undefinedxxxxxxxxxx columns selected*: R cannot find the column you think you‚Äôre asking for within the dataset. 
        * The colum is not in the data set, Use the colnames() function to check the column names.
        * make sure the indexing is correct or do not miss comma to separate the rows and columns [,].
    * JSON Schema error (I haven't currently installed ajv on this machine so that it takes some time to find the actuall error message): Array expected where only a string or object is provided
    *  The key expects an array even if it only contains one element.
    *  Add some suqare brackets around the value and you are safe.
* room 5 :
    * filenames/filepath: typo in the filename or path leading to errors (file does not exist) 
        *  the file likely exists, but the typo prevents the program from finding it >> explaining the path system and how these are structured.
    * R : dealing NA values when trying to compute mean()/sum() of vector
        * Explain what NA values are; explain why they must be dealt with for these operations; some strategies for dealing with NAs; and, why the computer doesn't just solve it for you 
    * with compiled languages, a mistyped variable usually causes a cascade of errors (that usually causes novices to panic that everything they did is wrong)
        * emphasize that we always start with the first error message, read it, spot the line that generate it and try to fix it
        * explain how variables are used in a program (I usually use the analogy of calling a person with their name, if we get the name wrong, they will not respond!)
        * understand that they should expect errors
* room 6 :
    * 0 / 1 indexed languages
    * students try to grab the 3rd element of an array oh shape 8 -> index 2 or 3? The last element of an array shape 8 is index 7 when 0-indexing is used
    * esp. when switching between languages (e.g. R/python)
    * can cause silent errors down the line
* room 7 :
    * Aoife: The relationship between Open Data, FAIR and RDM. It is not always clear when learners first engage with these concepts what the realtionship is. I explain it as a heirarchy with Open Data at the top of the pyramid, FAIR as the next level and RDM at the bottom as a Key enabler of the other two. Also a difficult concept is interoperability which in FAIR is very focused on machine readability which can be off putting. But we can take a human centric approach to interoperability when the infrastructure, metadata standards and skills are not available to researchers. So interoperability can exist on a spectrum. 
* when running Python code in Jupyter notebook while teaching due to not having run all preceding cells resulting in some variable(s) being not defined. Explain anatomy of Python error messages (error type, descriptive message, traceback) and how they can be used to figure out where error is arising. Also try to explain overall source of problem - being able to run cells in arbitrary order in Jupyter notebooks can make it difficult to infer what current state of session is, and common approach of repeatedly running subsets of cells and making changes in between can lead to difficult to diagnose errors.
* Divide by zero error: common in experimental contexts when sesnsors fail to read (report 0) and go on to be used in math operations. Explain that what is contained in variables may not be what you expect, how to retrieve the contents of variables, how to design checks for data sanity.

### Motivation and demotivation
Questions:
    Why is motivation important?
    How can we create a motivating environment for learners?
Objectives:
    Identify authentic tasks and explain why teaching using them is important.
    Develop strategies to avoid demotivating learners.
    Distinguish praise based on the type of mindset it promotes.
    
Motivation Matters

Any technique can fall flat when learners are not motivated
In a short workshop, motivation to continue learning independently is a critical outcome

How Can Content Influence Motivation?
- Believing that something will be too hard to learn often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

![](https://codimd.carpentries.org/uploads/upload_5acfccfc631ca1f5401af32c86bf4220.png)

#### Exercise: Authentic Tasks: Think, Pair, Share (10 min)
1) Think about some task you did this week that uses one or more of the skills we teach, (e.g. wrote a function, bulk downloaded data, built a plot in R, forked a repo) and explain how you would use it (or a simplified version of it) as an exercise or example in class. 
2) Pair up with your neighbor and decide where this exercise fits on a graph of ‚Äúshort/long time to master‚Äù and ‚Äúlow/high usefulness‚Äù. 
3) In the class Etherpad, share the task and where it fits on the graph. As a group, we will discuss how these relate back to our ‚Äúteach most immediately useful first‚Äù approach.

until 13:53

Room 1 
* Navigation on Linux directories
    * Very useful so users can access data and executables in the system(s), reasonably quick to become proficient.
* Use of GitHub repo
    * very basics of cloning etc relatively quick to teach, very useful
    * more advanced concepts such as versioning, a little longer, but equally useful

Room 2 

  * Providing a skeleton structure of code for a worked example
  * Opening a new pull-request or merge-request on github/gitlab to teach the workflow on how contribute to a 3rd party project
  * Example of writing a test for a piece of existing code - provide snippet of code plus description of expected behaviour and ask students to write a test (for example adding an `assert` statement) to check code behaves as expected. Relatively easy to learn (one line of code) but also potentially very useful in allowing early identification of incorrect behaviour in code.

Room 3 
* Easy, useful: For loop
* Easy, less useful: Theming graphs (e.g. in matplotlib or ggplot)
* Hard, useful: writing functions (or learning analysis techniques in a new field)
* Hard, not useful: specifics of deployoing SSL certifcates using Ansible
    
Room 4 
* cloning a git repo locally: it can be quite useful but requires a lot of previous understanding (bash, remotes etc.)
* loading a spreadsheet into R and getting summary statitsics
* Relatively quick to master; useful for analysis (though non-coding options available, e.g. GraphPad Prism)

Room 5 
* create a pie chart from data
* simple-complex pie charts (segments sticking out, updating labels on data, form / function tradeoffs, etc.)
* medium complexity (progression through course)
* very useful, discipline-independent, basic initial data analysis step, gives a feeling about data content / distribution

Room 6 
* Understanding the pitfalls of using excel, tidy data, data validation to help ensure clean data collection and mitigate the risks of excel 
* clear guidelines to follow in bringing the learners into the same pace before the training starts
* Teaching "pipe" and "for" loop in bash script, using simple-to-complex approach to let students build up their knowledge and also confidence.

#### Exercise: Brainstorming Motivational Impacts

Think back to courses you have taken in the past and consider things that an instructor has said or done that you found either motivating or demotivating. Try to think of one example in each case, and share your example under the appropriate heading in the Etherpad.
This exercise should take about 10 minutes, util 14:10

Room 1 
* Motivating:
    * putting the examples into a generic context
    * instructors giving tips of where to go next, even if not directly related to the course material (check this thing because it is fun, or relevant, or might interest you)
* Demotivating:
    * instructor went through the material very quickly
    * instructor not showing interest or sharing personal experience related to material (just reading the script)
    
Room 2 
* Demotivating: 
    * Having a non-expert trainer who is nonetheless very confident
    * An instructor who makes clear that he does not want to be there
    * a frontal approach with an instructor just reading the slides
* Motivating:
    * having hands-on examples to immediately put into practise what you are learning
    * being able to contribute with your experience as participants and faciliators who invite this and make clear that they are not experts on the whole subject range
    * a trainer who creates a positive atmosphere by including jokes, poems etc.


Room 3 
  * Motivating: 
      * Teachers who use own learning experiences to reassure students and provide examples of where they struggled with things and strategies they used to overcome
      * Teachers who are passionate about the topics they are teaching
      * Providing applied examples of where techniques being learned can be used in a 'real world' context
      * Well thought out training material, links to additional resources such as textbooks for further reading
  * Demotivating:
      * When teachers indicate they themselves are not motivated by material!
      * Teachers who imply material is easy
      * Overly mechanical approach to teaching and focus on assessment rather than learning

Room 4 
- Motivating
    * passionate instructors
    * contributing to research or real world
    * learning really useful things that you can really see the benefit of 
- Demotivating 
    * thing go too fast and you fall behind
    * when the instructor is not  motivated
    * when the materials are badly presented or sloppy

Room 5 
* Motivating:
    * Course leading you to contribute to society
    * Personal attention / tailored
    * Instructor with energy
* Demotivating
    * Exclusively abstract teaching
    * Exclusively example based teaching
    * Ethical disagreement with content provider
    * Mismatch between course content and group skills

Room 6 
* Motivating
    * Ask students who have finished the tasks to help those who are struggling with them
    * Praise students to help them build up confidence
    * Giving feedback regarding the pace of the learning relative to the complexity of the material
* Demotivating
    * Act in a suprised way when students did not know something 
    * Giving feedback on the course content specifying the course being really simple and too easy. 
    * Not sharing realstic and constructive feedback and "waving" the feedback process for the sake of doing it.

#### Invite Participation
- Establishing norms for interaction
- Encouraging learners to learn from each other
- Acknowledging when learners are confused
 
#### Exercise: Helping Learners Learn From Mistakes 
A learner at your workshop asks for your help with an exercise and shows you their attempt at solving it. You see they‚Äôve made an error that shows they misunderstand something fundamental about the lesson (for example, in the shell lesson, they forgot to put a space between ls and the name of the directory they are looking at). What would you say to the learner?
In the Collaborative Document, describe the error your learner has made and how you would respond.
This exercise should take about 5 minutes. ‚åõ Until 14:22.

* 
    * I would say that I likely did not explain this correctly, and go over it again with the learner one on one to fix get the student/learner to fix the mistake and then make sure no one else made the same mistake. 
* 
    * I would point out the error ("The problem here is that...") and show how it can be done successfully ("In order to make it run, you need to...")
* 
    * The learner had to document their research data using the Dublin Core Element. For the attribute subject, they mentioned the patients of their study. 
    * I would tell them that, usually, this field rather refer to the topic of their project/dataset, and not to a person.
* 
  * I would try to frame this as a chance to learn about how to debug code and try to encourage the learner to step through how they have approached the problem and what the error they are getting is saying to try to identify where the problem is. This could be guided by giving some hints / questions that might help identify what is causing the problem, and encouraging the student to try out changes to see how the behaviour of the code varies as the input is changed.
* 
    I would suggest them to revisit the concept and make sure they grasp it and ask them to solve the problem havind understood the concept. 
* 
    * For the shell example: I would point out that by having both the correct command and the right directory they were close to getting it right. I would try to restate the structure of a typical command "command *space* input", before pointing out what they would need to do to fix what they have done
* 
    * My approach would be to take as step back from the exercise and suggest that we revist the underlying theory together as I may not have been clear at the outset. Work through the theory together and then one seem confident suggest they try the exercise again. Will my help or independently if they prefer. 
* 
    * It depends when that misunderstanding occurs: if early on (i.e., soon after the concept was initially explained), I would go over it again, trying to find a different explanation, maybe getting learners to set their own goal. If we were a few hours or days into the workshop, I would point out the mistake, and go through the concept with the student again, at the end of the day.
* 
    * "Ah, just a typo. Easy to miss, happens all the time. You of course know that a space separates function and input - otherwise the computer won't know what's what. The space is missing here."
* 
    * If using the example of a user not putting a space between the "ls" command and a directory name I would try to have the user explain to me if they can think of a reason why the error happened. If they had none I would explain that the system requires spaces to differentiate between commands and arguments
* 
    * Using the given example: "Hey, let us think about what each part of this bit of code means. Ls is a function, i.e. it does something based on the provided inputs. These inputs, such as the directory you tying here, are provided to a function by typing next to the function, separating each input by a space. This way you can encode several different inputs. But remember, you have to use spaces to let the system read where one function or input ends and another begins"
* 
    * I tell him to repeat the command line. It is normal to get it wrong the first few times you type the command line. Only with practice can you improve. 
* 
    * I would say "look, try to add a space between the command `ls` and the directory name", after they do it I would explain a bit about how command line works with options, arguments and so on, and maybe if I have time I would teach how to read the manpage of any command, then they will be able to learn other commands besides the `ls` command.
* 
    * I don't have a specific example in mind. It would be a great opportunity to do a (quick) revision of the material, and emphasize on the main points that should be well understood to proceed. I find that repetition is always helpful to fill gaps, even if no major misunderstandings occur.
* 
   * I would not directly point out their mistakes, but I will show them the correct way again, and tell them that "space" is very important.
* 
    * I would reiterate the previous concept in a more basic way with a quick example before focusing on the current problem without putting emphasis on their lackings but more in a constructive flow to create a unitary understanding. 
* 
    * Perhaps not the best solution: I explain the concept to the learner and try to come back to the topic into the general audience (whidout pointing to the learner). In my experience, the error will occur in repeated cases within the group.s not the best solution: I explain the concepts not the best solution: I explain the concepts not the best solution: I explain the concepts not the best solution: I explain the concepts not the best solution: I explain the concepts not the best solution: I explain the concepts not the best solution: I explain the concepts not the best solution: I explain the concepts not the best solution: I explain the concept
* 
    * I would simply explain the same concept again practically in a shell window and provide more examples of shell commands. This is a usual mistake that every learner does while learning concepts in linux and usually most important which aree quite useful as well. 

- Presenting the Instructor as a Learner
- "The typos are the pedagogy" 
- Praising effort or improvement, not performance or ability

#### First, Do No Harm!
Things not to do in a workshop:
- Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool or practice, or the people who use them.
- Dive into complex or detailed technical discussion with the one or two people in the audience who clearly don‚Äôt actually need to be there. 
- Pretend to know more than you do. 
- Use the J word (‚Äújust‚Äù) or other demotivating words we talked about in a previous lesson. 
- Take over the learner‚Äôs keyboard. 
- Express surprise at unawareness. 

#### Keypoints:
- A positive learning environment helps people concentrate on learning.
- People learn best when they see the utility in what they're learning and believe it can be accomplished with reasonable effort.
- Encouraging participation and embracing errors helps learners to stay motivated.

### Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility
- Questions:
    - Why are equity, inclusion, and accessibility important?
    - What can I do enhance equity, inclusion, and accessibility in my workshop?
- Objectives:
    - Identify instructional strategies that are consistent with universal design.
    - Recognize systemic factors that can distract and demotivate learners.
    - Understand the role of The Carpentries Code of Conduct in maintaining an explicitly inclusive environment.

#### Definitions
**Equity**: The proportional distribution of desirable outcomes across groups. Sometimes confused with equality, equity refers to outcomes while equality connotes equal treatment.

**Inclusion:**  Actively engaging traditionally excluded individuals and/or groups in processes, activities and decisions in a way that shares power. Inclusion promotes broad engagement, shared participation, and advances authentic sense of belonging through safe, positive, and nurturing environments.

**Accessibility:** Refers to the intentional design or redesign of technology, policies, products, and services (to name a few) that increase one‚Äôs ability to use, access, and obtain the respective item. Each person is afforded the opportunity to acquire the same information, engage in the same interactions, and enjoy the same services in an equally effective and equally integrated manner, with substantially equivalent ease of use.

#### Exercise: Discuss The Carpentries Core Values
Take a moment to read through the Core Values on this page: [Core Values](https://carpentries.org/values/)

Choose one core value that resonates with you. What is a decision you might make in a workshop that could look different if you were actively considering the core value you chose?

This exercise should take about 10 minutes. ‚åõ until 14:53

Room 1 
* Inclusive of all -- bringing people from from all sorts of backgrounds can illuminates something you might be using to teach for years!
* Access for all people
* Empower One Another: Allow learners to help one another (peer learning) in explaining concepts or correcting exercises
Room 2 
* Empower One Another: One could easily fall into the trap of doing the teaching by oneself instead of enabling peer-to-peer learning
* Openess: Produce more easily accessible slides, e.g. html slides published on the web instead of PowerPoint slides, to ensure all can access with minimum setup
* Always Learning: make it explicit that I, as instructor, am also always a learner; make clear that participants will have more expertise on some topics of the course. Give the opportunity to bring examples to the course.

Room 3 
  * Inclusive for all: 
      * Timing workshops in a way to allow for those with caring responsibilities
      * Ensuring adequate breaks for participants
      * Avoiding gendered or otherwise exclusive language
      * Using random allocation when asking questions
  * Valuing all contributions

Room 4 
* Access for all 
    * Not just physical access but access to online materials is really important
    * Available transcripts 
    * Descriptions of figures
    * Font and colour choice for readbility
    * Downloadable materials when connectivity is bad
    * access on different types of devices, tablets, laptops, phones 
    * use open software,  free platforms 

Room 5 
    If we were to take into consideration the People First and Access for All principles, one would design a course using an open-source technology instead of a proprietary one.

Room 6 
* Act Openly: Don't pretend to know something that I actually don't know especially when a student asks a good question. We can google it together to look for answers. Sometimes if a student knows something better than me, I would kinly invite this student to explain it for me. 
* People first and empovering the strenght and diverse skills of the others matters creating a collaborative conscious that would facilitate tackling issues all together 
* Access for all: Provide a common platform for everyone to deliver teaching or workshops. Usually happens with users who don't have access to linux workstations or OS (usually with Windows users). In this way, we provide a common platform or a resource which will allow everyone to access the data/resource.

#### From Accomodation to Universal Design
Universal Design in Learning (UDL)
The key to UDL is creating redundancies such that learners have multiple options in how they:
1) receive
2) engage, and
3) share information.

#### Exercise: Activity: Applying Universal Design in Your Teaching -- --

- Consider some of the teaching tools and strategies we have discussed so far in this workshop, or others you have observed in your experience. How do these meet UDL goals of providing multiple options for learners?
- Consider multiple ways for learners to:
    - receive information
    - engage with you, the material, and other learners
    - share what they have learned
This exercise should take  10 minutes. ‚åõ 15:07

Room 1 
* Having materials available before the workshop, but also those materials be in open and accessible formats (i.e., that can be opened by everyone regardless of software, and interpreted by accessibility tools)
* making sure the virtual workshop platform is compatible with multiple types of devices, e.g. laptops, tablets, mobiles, etc. so that is it accessible by as many learners possible

Room 2 
* Receive information: Provide slides and or report with presentation, allowing students who lose attention to catch-up/refocus (include alt text for images)
* Engage: Getting students to work on a single shared document / breakout rooms / work groups (more directed)
* Share: Encourage sharing experience in shared document (report). Presentations

Room 3 

  * Providing material in multiple formats - for example video recordings, written material (quick summaries / take-home messages), live delivery, short-intervals (e.g. not next day, etc. maybe before the next break)
  * Increased accessibility from having courses delivered virtually - potentially more accessible to those with caring responsibilities or disabilities that may make attending a course in person difficult.
  * Trying to avoid use of idiomatic language that can be difficult for non-native speakers to understand.
  * Using tools such as quick polls, Zoom reactions, to get continual feedback from learners.

Room 4 
* Make materials available in advance
* Live presentation/ teaching / case studies/ annecdotes 
* Practical application/ exercise to reinforce the learning
* discussion/ Q&A 
    
Room 5 
* Cultural barriers, like examples with baseball for people who does not have idea about how baseball works
    * Also language barries, like, people who does not speaks english for eg.
* Does the diversity is included in the UDL concept somehow?
* Logistical barriers - can hybrid sessions help more people attend?

Room 6 
* Send lesson materials before the workshop starts
* Periodic feedback mechanism to improve the teaching from both the learner and teacher perspective throughout the course
* Use breakout rooms for small group discussion

# Episodes 11 - 12

## 11 Teaching is a skill

### Exercise (10 min) until 15:58

- We will start by observing some examples of teaching and providing some feedback.
- Watch [example teaching video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApVt04rB4U) and then give feedback on it.
- Put your feedback in the Collaborative Document.
- Organize your feedback along two axes: positive vs. opportunities for growth (sometimes called ‚Äúnegative‚Äù) and content (what was said) vs. presentation (how it was said).

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApVt04rB4U)

* 
    * Positive: he is demonstrating live and open for questions
    * Opportunities for growth: avoid the use of words like "simple stuffs", "of course"; possibility to use a mistake for further explanations, further explanation rather than asking the learners to "trust" him.
* 
    * positive:
        * live coding is good
        * lively presentation 
    * opportunites for growth:
        * be respectful towards participants
        * don't demotivate participants by bashing technologies (Excel)
        * use a bigger font so that people can read 
        * don't use too much technical jargon, and if you do explain it
        * take errors you make as an opportunity to show that this is normal and it is an opportunity to learn from it (and not a bad thing)
* 
    * Presentation - Positive: live coding, acknowledge own mistake, ask if there are questions
    * Presentation - Opportunities for growth: font size too small; use of language such as "simple", "of course", "trust me"
* 
* 
    * Oppurtunities    
        * Size of the fond was too small.
        * Super fast.
        * The presentation was not structured. 
        * Avoid using dismissive language.
        * was distracted and not focused on.
        * Respect your audiences.
    * Positive
        * Live coding. 
        * Acknowledge your mistake.
* 
    * Useful to watch someone demonstrating programming live
    * Explanation was often too detailed or technical without explaining motivation
    * Tone was sometimes patronising or dismissive
    * Opportunity was missed when mistake during demo was corrected without explanation
* 
  * Positives
      * was knowledgeable 
  * Opportunities for growth
    * Review what was done before the break
    *   screen is too small/ txt on screen too small
    *  instructor was impatient
    *   dismissive of excel users/ negative about excel
    *  instructor is distracted/ checks phone
    *  seems underprepared for the class
    *  didn't explain his own mistake 
    *   too fast, explain each step more slowly
    *   use less jargon
* 
    * the start sounds a little aggressive, the atmosphere could be a little more positive
    * the screen is quite hard to see, zoom in on the code
    * dismissive of the difficulties learners might encounter ('even excel users get it')
    * clearly very knowledgeable, but not attuned to the knowledge level of the audience
    * the language is not particularly appropriate to level of teaching (i.e., a really introductory subject explained with words that are meant to be for advanced users)
    * might benefit from pre-preparing examples, seems uncertain of where to go next
    * struggles to explain simple concepts, asks learners to 'trust him'
* 
    * positive:
        * presentation:
            * talks to audience
            * asks if students have questions
        * content:
            * seems well-versed in subject matter
    * opportunities:
        * presentation
            * seems frustrated, annoyed at students, stressed, doesn't want to be there
            * seems unorganized
            * adjust microphone, makes a weird masking noise
            * font on projector much too small
            * lots of filler words
            * gestures towards screen, can't see what is being gestured at
        * content:
            * too technical language ('instantiating a function object')
            * doesn't explain own mistake, seems embarassed by iy
* 
    * Areas that require improvement:
        * Personal presentation: Checks mobile phone in the middle of the class therefore not giving his full attention to the students. Appears to be in need or organising the lesson. These give the impression of not wanting to be there.
        * Did not check that everyone is able to read the code on the whiteboard/screen.
* 
    * Positive presentation - willing to be seen to make errors
    * Positives content - Live examples to engage;
    * Opportunities presentation - Be more respectful to students; enlarge text on screen 
    * Opportunities content - don't bash alternatives; have a clearer lesson plan
* 
    * The presentation is small. I do not see the command line. I think that the students did not see the functions;
    *  the teacher was distracted;
    * the teacher initially used an unwelcoming tone;
    * the language was too technical.
* 
    * positive: doing live code is good to learn by examples, explaining while coding is good
    * opportunities for growth: font-size on screen too small, hard to follow. Avoid saying "it is simple...". It could be slower, too fast, hard to follow, specially due to live coding.
    * content (what was said) vs. presentation (how it was said): lack of visual representation about the subjects on screen, hard to follow just with live coding
* 
     * Opportunities for growth
        * language: don't use "just", "simply", "simple"...
        * pace: he was going to fast
        * material: too many concepts mentioned in just a few sentences
        * presentation: font size have to be larger
        * teaching style: allow time for questions
    * Positive
        * live coding
* 
  * Content
      * What went well
          * Instructor appears to know material well  
      * What could be improved
          * Text size on screen too small
          * Use of unmeaningful variable names for example `foo`
          * Not explaining error and how resolved
          * Covering higher-level functions / functors in a lesson aimed at novices who may not have encountered functions before
    * Presentation
      * What went well
          * Instructor invited learners to ask question (though unclear if they allowed enough time for responses!)
      * What could be improved
          * Exasperated tone at late student
          * Clarity of speech / stuttering, lots of _umm_ fillers
          * Use of demotivational language like _just_ and _really simple_, _what you would expect_
          * Denigration of Excel users
          * Use of jargon without explanation _lexical binding_, _polymorphic_, _functor_
          * Checking phone during lesson
          * Sudden speed up at end
* 
  * Positive
      * Instructor is confident and seems to be knowledgeable.
  * Negative
      * Text on the screen is too small.
      * Pace is too fast.
      * Phone is not turned off. 
      * "This is really simple stuff, I mean even Excel users can understand this."
  
  
*  - I cannot type somehow 
    * Content vs presentation: Gives the feeling of not much prethought went into the examples which makes following the instructions hard.
    * Screen size is too small makes te presentation hard to follow. 
    * opportunities to improve: 
* 
  * To Improve:
    * Text too small on screen
    * He turns the back to the audience when indicating of the screen
    * The content could have been better prepared
    * Include slides on explanations
    * Distracted by a participant
  * Well done:
    * Bringing examples Improve:
* 
    * Screen not visible. Text too small.
    * Explaining concepts really fast
    * Doing live coding a plus
    * Did not allowed time for feedback or not enough time given for Q and A. 

### Exercise: Sharing Feedback (~25 min) until 16:25

1. You will be split into breakout rooms with the groups of three.
2. Individually, spend 5 minutes preparing a 90-second introduction to the topic of the lesson episode you chose before the start of the training course. You will not be live coding.
3. Get together with your group and have one person teach their segment to the group. Keep a strict time limit of 90 seconds per person (one person should be responsible for the timekeeping).
4. After the first person has finished teaching, share feedback. The person who performed should start by offering feedback on themselves. The timekeeper should help to keep feedback to about 5 minutes per person to ensure everyone has time to perform and discuss.
5. Rotate roles and repeat steps 3 & 4
6. Return to the main group and briefly summarize the feedback you received in the Collaborative Document.

Room 1
  *    good pacing and examples given. Avoid using technical words in the intrduction
  *  Positives: Good use of analogy, Good explanation of
        technical terms; Things to improve: might have talked a little too fast; could have changed the order of concept - definition (to definition, concept)

Room 2

* clear lesson plan
* clear language
* keep it shorter cut specifics
* provide introduction
* Change: better preparation to stick to the designated time (as I chose the [Importing data into OpenRefine](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-open-refine/02-importing-data/index.html) bit that comes _after_ the introduction, I guess it was ok to not introduce OpenRefine itself...)

* Purpose was clear
* Good use of example
* Should include visualisation 
* (maybe) Avoid redundancy at end
 - introduction to the package taxlist
* to improve:
    * Better introduction from presentation session
    * Slide with image of taxonomists (to put the presentation in context)

* Went good:
    * Purpose explained in the introduction* Went good:

Room 3
   * positive:
     * short summary of previous part of lesson
     * somewhat structured for 90 second segment of 20 min course
   * improvable:
        * somewhat abrupt ending of motivation for this segment
        * code concepts somewhat short, partly because 90 second limit
    * change based on feedback:
         * smooth transition of motivation, join with code recap
         * take more time explaining code concepts, shift temporal focus

 (58 sec)
 
*  
  * Goal/benefit was clear 
  * Not necessary to ask for questions at this stage
   * Good pace
   * Avoid using terms that might not be clear to everyone

* 
  * Good use of previous example to motivate why to use loops
    * Highlighting specific part of code being referred to with cursor would help
    * Delivery of material a bit quick

Room 4

* super interesting, speaking fast

* clear/structured; make sure to define basic terms
  good overview of basic concepts; outline the learning goals

* Feedback summary: make the goal of the lecture clear, outline the main learning outcomes, be careful of speaking slowly/clearly

Room 5

* Positive: approachable (OW motivating example?)
* Need to improve: Offer more background on the data (the topic introduced was teh imprtance of backups)

* positive: mixing theory and practice is a good point
* opportunity for improvement: spend more time explaining why and how the tool (git) is useful
* changes based on feedback: I would spend time finding good examples on real world where git is usefull before start talking about the tool and I would talk about those real use cases on the first steps on the presentation
    

* positive: style of speaking good, enthusiasm and knowledge of subject
* opportunity: slides hard to understand (small text)
* improvment: work on improving the quality and understandablity of slides

Room 6

* Less wording in the slides but more supplementary visuals and brief introduction is enough to start to the presentation
* Try to avoid too much text. More visuals (figures, flowcharts, tables, etc). For myself, too much time spent on introduction.
* Better to have some slides; shorten the introduction; show some cool images; avoid awareness gaps (use simple words), etc. 

### Exercise: Using Feedback (5 min)

- Look back at the feedback you received on your teaching. How do you feel about this feedback? Is it fair and reasonable? Do you agree with it?
-  Identify at least one specific change you will make to your teaching based on this feedback. Describe your change in the Collaborative Document.
* 
    * Thanks Tiago and Giannis. I need to improve exposure. I have to avoid taking fewer breaks and I have to be safer.

* Feedback was fair; I would generate either a visual abstract for the presentation or a screenshot of a data frame within R

* I would reserve the first 25 seconds of my 90" allocation to include the information that I omitted from my first short talk.

* 
    * Feedback was fair and very helpful. A specific (and easy to address change) is to introduce the definition of the concept *before* introducing its technical name -- definitely will apply moving forward. Pacing is harder to address, but will keep in mind when preparing material beforehand
* 

* 
    * Agree with all feedback - very fair comments!
    * Try to consciously add pauses / slow down when speaking.
    * More carefully link what being said to code displayed on screen by talking through code and highlighting relevant sections

* I would make sure that I define the key words/concepts as I speak. 
* The feedback I get for my slides regarding teh density of the content fit into the slides were constructive that I definitely need to thrive on.
* The feedback I got was fair and helpful. It is really hard to present in 90 seconds, however the material should be adjusted to the time given for presentation. Secondly, presenting hard conecpts in the beginning of the presentation should be avoided and instead more general topics should be considered.


* 
    * The feedback that I got was fair and completely reasonable. I totally agree with it. 
    * I make sure the outline my lesson and state the goal of the lesson. 

*  
        * "In this lesson, you will also learn to limit typing by using tab completion, meaning the program automatically fills what you have started typing." 
    * List more benefits of using command lines instead of GUIs.
    * Do not ask for questions at this stage.

* 
    * define the terms in the beginning, or use a synonym so that learners can makethe connection with something they know.
    * Feedback was fair, constructive and helpful

* 
  * Feedbacks were fair.
  * I should have some slides or images to show rather than simply talking.
  * I should avoid "expert" awareness gaps.
  * I should shorten the introduction part. 
  * I should prepare for the presentation better.

* 
    * feedback was fair and really nice. Main thing I need to work on is the speed at which I speak, and I need to enunciate clearly.

## 12 Homework

To prepare for tomorrow, please:

Read about [centrally-organized and self-organized workshops](https://carpentries.org/workshops/#workshop-organising) and our handbook content on [Teaching and Hosting Workshops](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/index.html) ‚Äì be sure to click through to some of the associated checklists. These summarize commonly asked questions about organizing and running workshops. When you arrive tomorrow, we will ask you to add one question about our operations to a list. We will then do our best to answer all of those questions during the day.

Prepare for the live coding exercises. If you have not already done so per the pre-workshop instructions, pick an episode from an existing Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, or Library Carpentry lesson and read through it carefully. Tomorrow, you will use this to practice live coding/participatory instruction for 3 minutes. Remember, imperfect presentations can generate useful feedback!
